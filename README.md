# PickACardBlazor

is a small Blazor Web Assembly app that uses the class in the previous Console App
I built, [PickRandomCards](https://github.com/gregidonut/PIckRandomCards), to make 
a kind of simple gui for its main method

the point was to be able to play around with both Blazor and mostly the C# programming
language with a focus on reusing classes and some blazor specific features
